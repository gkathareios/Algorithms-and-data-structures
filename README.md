# Algorithms-and-data-structures

A few implementations in C++ of algorithms and data structures that I encountered while studying the relevant course.
Disclaimer: I cannot guarantee these codes are bug-free, they have not been properly tested. Also, this is NOT how anyone should code, the code is not formatted, there are very few comments and the file structure is hideous. It is only meant to help understand the algorithms and data structures.
